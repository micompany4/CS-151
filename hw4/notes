I completed the objective of the homework in terms of the observer pattern and creating two frames that talk to each other to form "graphs."
The graphs are not rectangle class shapes, but are noted by "[#]" for 1. I was having trouble creating rectangles and aligning them on an axis 
for the bar graphs so I comprimised with "[#]."
